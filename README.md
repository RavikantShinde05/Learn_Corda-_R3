# Learning Corda (R3)

This repository is for Learning purpose and provide all the learning resources of R3_corda(2023). This is an Old Version of Corda currently R3 Labs Foundation is Rebuilding aspects of Corda.

This repository documents my journey of learning **Corda** , an enterprise-grade distributed ledger platform developed by **R3**.  
It contains notes and resources to understand how Corda works in practice.

## 🚀 What is Corda?

Corda is a **permissioned blockchain platform** designed for businesses.  
Unlike public blockchains, Corda focuses on:
- Privacy
- Legal enforceability
- Scalability
- Direct peer-to-peer transactions

Corda is commonly used in **finance, supply chain, trade finance, and enterprise applications**.

## 📚 What You’ll Find in This Repository

- 📄 **Concept Notes**
  - Corda architecture
  - Nodes, vaults, and flows
  - States, contracts, and transactions

- 🧩 **Sample CorDapps**
  - Basic CorDapp structure
  - Flows and contracts examples
  - Node communication demos

- 🔗 **Useful Resources**
  - Official R3 documentation
  - Tutorials and learning links

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Corda (R3)**
- **Kotlin** (primary language for CorDapps)
- **Gradle**
- **Java (JDK 8 / 11)**
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended)

## 🖥 Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- Java JDK installed
- Gradle installed
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Basic understanding of:
  - Kotlin or Java
  - Blockchain fundamentals

🎯 Learning Goals

## Understand how Corda differs from traditional blockchains

- Build and deploy simple CorDapps
- Learn real-world enterprise blockchain concepts
- Gain hands-on experience with distributed ledger systems


## Some of the confusing Concepts of Corda and Demerits are:

## 1.Corda is not a typical blockchain
This confused a lot of people.

Corda:
- ❌ Has no global chain
- ❌ Has no mining
- ❌ Is not decentralized like Ethereum

Instead, it’s a permissioned DLT for enterprises.

This made it less attractive to:
- Developers who wanted open/public blockchains
- Startups looking for tokens or DeFi-style apps

## 2. Very enterprise-focused (small audience)

Corda is designed mainly for:
- Banks
- Financial institutions
- Regulated industries

## Problems:

- Hard for individuals to experiment
- Long sales cycles
- Fewer public projects

Compared to Ethereum or Solana, Corda has:
- Smaller developer community
- Fewer tutorials
- Less online support

## 3. Complexity and learning curve:

- Corda development involves:
- Kotlin + JVM
- Complex concepts (states, contracts, flows, notaries)
- Heavy setup (nodes, certificates, network configs)

Many developers found:
- It’s harder to learn
- Slower to prototype
- Overkill for simple use cases

## 4. R3’s business challenges:

R3 (the company behind Corda):
- Shifted focus multiple times
- Reduced public visibility
- Moved toward private partnerships rather than open community growth

## This made Corda feel:
Less “alive”
Less innovative compared to fast-moving ecosystems

## 🤝 Contributing

This repository is primarily for learning, but suggestions and improvements are welcome.
